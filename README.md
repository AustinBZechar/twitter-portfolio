<h3>Lets be honest here, No one likes to get scammed.</h3>
<b>This is why I am releasing this to the public. I am standing up for myself & releasing it.</b>

<b>This is the person who scammed me. He said I cannot stand up for myself, but this is how I actually stand up for myself. If I get scammed, I leak the code and/or put them on my wall of scams (coming soon). If its a service I put them on the wall of scams. Never assume I do not stand up for myself when I post something & someone says something as that is never my intention. I do not want people to say stuff, they just do & I cannot control that.</b>
